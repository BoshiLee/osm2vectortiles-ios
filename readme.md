Building upon https://github.com/klokantech/osm2vectortiles-ios, now an iOS app
can be built to have local vector data, styles, glyphs and sprites.

Features

* 100% local data (notice in the animation that WiFi is turned off at the beginning of the demo)
* Vector data built using http://OSM2VectorTiles.org
* Styling of the countries is from https://github.com/klokantech/mapbox-gl-js-offline-example
